# Read in Seoul Bike Data use read.csv; had to assign fileEncoding to get the dataset to load in

# EDA

### Checking the Data

```{r}
# I'm starting by checking for missingness in the data using is.na to see the number of missing values. No missing values were found. 
sum(is.na(bike_data))
colSums(is.na(bike_data))
```

```{r}
# Now I need to check the data structure. The numeric variables are numeric, but the categorical variables were read in as character strings, and the date is also character strings, so I need to convert both of those. I also checked the categorical variables for unique values, to confirm consistency in the dataset. 
str(bike_data)
summary(bike_data)
unique(bike_data$Seasons)
unique(bike_data$Holiday)
unique(bike_data$Functioning.Day)
```

```{r}
# Next, I need to convert the Date column into an actual date using lubridate.
bike_data <- bike_data |>
  mutate(Date = dmy(Date))
# Checking if it worked
head(bike_data$Date, 10)
class(bike_data$Date)
```
  
```{r}
# Now I will convert the character variables into factors.
bike_data <- bike_data |>
  mutate(
    Seasons = as.factor(Seasons),
    Holiday = as.factor(Holiday),
    Functioning.Day = as.factor(Functioning.Day)
  )
# Checking to see if it worked
class(bike_data$Seasons)
class(bike_data$Holiday)
class(bike_data$Functioning.Day)
```

```{r}
# Simplify column names to make them easier to work with 
colnames(bike_data) <- (c("date", "bike_count", "hour", "temp", "humidity", "wind_speed", "visibility", "dew_point_temp", "solar_radiation", "rainfall", "snowfall", "seasons", "holiday", "functioning_day"))
# Checking new names
head(bike_data)
```
